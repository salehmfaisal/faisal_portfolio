      <description>For this end-to-end project I built a wine classifier to identify wines produce by different concentration of mixtures. This could be useful for someone who is new to wine industry. They could provide the concentration level of mixtures and an app cpuld serve them with identification of quality of wine. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities.
I was able to get a model to predict the wine quality with 84.</description>

      <description>Created a tool that estimates car price to help new buyers to negotiate the car price with seller. Collected the data set from kaggle competition and explore, clean the data set to fit a model by python. Engineered features from the data set to quantify the value car selling companies put on fuel type, seller type, Transmission. Optimized Linear, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, KNeighborsRegressor, XGBRegressor using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.</description>

      <description>We are delighted to be able to inform the reader, that during the whole of this scene, Gringoire and his piece had stood firm. His actors, spurred on by him, had not ceased to spout his comedy, and he had not ceased to listen to it. He had made up his mind about the tumult, and was determined to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return of attention on the part of the public.</description>

      <description>In the twinkling of an eye, all was ready to execute Coppenole’s idea. Bourgeois, scholars and law clerks all set to work. The little chapel situated opposite the marble table was selected for the scene of the grinning match. A pane broken in the pretty rose window above the door, left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the competitors should thrust their heads. In order to reach it, it was only necessary to mount upon a couple of hogsheads, which had been produced from I know not where, and perched one upon the other, after a fashion.</description>

      <description>While the pensioner of Ghent and his eminence were exchanging very low bows and a few words in voices still lower, a man of lofty stature, with a large face and broad shoulders, presented himself, in order to enter abreast with Guillaume Rym; one would have pronounced him a bull-dog by the side of a fox. His felt doublet and leather jerkin made a spot on the velvet and silk which surrounded him.</description>

      <description>Poor Gringoire! the din of all the great double petards of the Saint-Jean, the discharge of twenty arquebuses on supports, the detonation of that famous serpentine of the Tower of Billy, which, during the siege of Paris, on Sunday, the twenty-sixth of September, 1465, killed seven Burgundians at one blow, the explosion of all the powder stored at the gate of the Temple, would have rent his ears less rudely at that solemn and dramatic moment, than these few words, which fell from the lips of the usher, “His eminence, Monseigneur the Cardinal de Bourbon.</description>
